# PredictiveMaintenance 🚀

Welcome to the **PredictiveMaintenance** project! This repository is designed to harness the power of machine learning for predictive maintenance of industrial machinery. Our solution integrates cutting-edge algorithms to detect potential failures before they occur, saving time, reducing costs, and contributing to a sustainable industrial future.

## 🔍 About the Project

In modern industries, unexpected equipment failures can lead to significant operational downtime and financial losses. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including:

- **Autoencoder Algorithms** for anomaly detection
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM)** for high-performance classification
- **CatBoost Classifier** for handling categorical features effectively
- **Stacked Generalization** to combine multiple models and enhance predictive accuracy

Our goal is to develop a robust system that supports efficient maintenance scheduling, reduces resource waste, and aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9, 12, and 13.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔧 **Early Fault Detection** – Identify issues before they escalate
- 📊 **Advanced Machine Learning Models** – Improve prediction accuracy
- 🌿 **Sustainability Focus** – Minimize environmental impact through efficient resource usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashankAlagawadi/PredictiveMaintenance.git
cd PredictiveMaintenance
```

2. Set up the environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
